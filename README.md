# WCTC-Esports-MMR

This project is a Node.js application that uses the Express.js framework to serve a web page displaying player data for the esports teams.

The application fetches player data from an API and renders it on the web page using EJS (Embedded JavaScript) templates.

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
2. Start the server with `node Main`.
3. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

Please note that you need to provide your own API key in a `.env` file for the application to fetch player data. In format of `API_KEY=your_api_key_here`.
